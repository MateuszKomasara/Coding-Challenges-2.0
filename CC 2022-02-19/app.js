// Challenge :

// A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you. The brick's length and width are equal, forming a square; its height may be different. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will accept these parameters:
// * radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
// * bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
// * rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
// And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.



// Solution :

function iceBrickVolume(radius, bottleLength, rimLength) {
     return (bottleLength - rimLength) * radius * 2 * radius;
  
}
