// DropCaps means that the first letter of the starting word of the paragraph should be in caps and the remaining lowercase, just like you see in the newspaper.

// But for a change, let"s do that for each and every word of the given String. Your task is to capitalize every word that has length greater than 2, leaving smaller words as they are.

// *should work also on Leading and Trailing Spaces and caps.

// "apple"            => "Apple"
// "apple of banana"  => "Apple of Banana"
// "one   space"      => "One   Space"
// "   space WALK   " => "   Space Walk   " 

function dropCap(n) {
    return n.split(' ').map(x => x.length >2? x[0].toUpperCase() + x.slice(1).toLowerCase(): x).join(' ')
   }
